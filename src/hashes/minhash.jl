MinHash struct definition and constructors
========================#

"""
MinHash implementation for Jaccard similarity-based hashing on sets. A `MinHash` struct takes as input a `Set` or `Vector` and computes one or more hashes for it. These hashes are locality-sensitive hashes for Jaccard similarity, defined as

    Sim(A, B) = length(A ∩ B) / length(A ∪ B)

    MinHash(
        symbols :: C,

Sample hash function(s) from the MinHash family over the symbol set `symbols`.

## Arguments
- `symbols :: Union{Vector{T}, Set{T}}`: a `Vector` or `Set` containing all of the possible elements ("symbols") of the sets that you will be hashing.
- `n_hashes :: Integer`: the number of distinct hash functions that you want to create. The resulting `MinHash` struct will compute `n_hashes` hashes for each input that you provide.

    MinHash(
        dtype :: DataType,
        n_hashes :: Integer)

Sample some new MinHash hash functions, where elements of the sets that you'll be hashing have type `dtype`. The `MinHash` struct returned by this constructor is lazily updated whenever it hashes a set with an element it's never seen before. Use this constructor for `MinHash` when you don't know ahead of time all of the possible elements of the sets that you'll be hashing.

Note that the `MinHash` struct returned by the `MinHash(::C, ::Integer) where {T, C <: Union{Vector{T}, Set{T}}}` constructor is generally more efficient. If you know in advance all of the possible elements of the sets that you'll be hashing, you should probably go with that constructor instead.

## Arguments
- `dtype :: DataType`: the type elements in the sets that you'll be hashing.
- `n_hashes :: Integer`: the number of distinct hash functions that you want to create. The resulting `MinHash` struct will compute `n_hashes` hashes for each input that you provide.
